# JasperReportsIntegration
JasperReportsIntegration provides an interface to use the JasperReports reporting engine in an Oracle database application, specifically with Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX).

You can download the different binary release here: http://www.opal-consulting.de/downloads/free_tools/JasperReportsIntegration/
or also here on github https://github.com/daust/JasperReportsIntegration/releases for all future releases. 

There is a FORUM for getting help here: https://gitq.com/daust/JasperReportsIntegration. Please be as specific as possible (error message, what is working, what is not working, steps to reproduce, operating system and version of application server, JasperReportsIntegration and application server). 

Cheers, 
~Dietmar.
