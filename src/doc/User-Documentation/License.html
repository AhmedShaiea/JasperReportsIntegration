<h3>So what does this legalese mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
The BSD style license is very different from the GNU Public License.
While the GNU license puts all sorts of restrictions on what you can do
with the software, BSD-style licenses say "Hey, do what you like, we
don't care. Just let people know we wrote it, and don't sue us." That's
really all there is to it. <br>
<br>
The first paragraph with the numbered items says you can do what you
like with the code, as long as you keep our name on it. And you cannot
use our name(s) for advertising.
<br>
<br>
The second paragraph, all in capital letters, is a standard legal
boilerplate notification that tries to make it difficult for anyone to
successfully sue us over the software. </div>
